            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
            <p>I'm Anne Kyle V. Mantilla from 9-Barium, and it's nice to meet you. This website is dedicated to raising awareness about climate change and how to stop it. One of the website's objectives was to promote the UN campaign because the 10 steps they provided may be completed by anybody, regardless of age, gender, or occupation, and we will also be able to lower our carbon footprints. If we band together, even modest actions can have a significant influence.</p>

            <h1>CHOOSING THIS ADVOCACY</h1>
            <p>You may contribute to living sustainably in whatever capacity you are at the moment, whether it be as a student, teacher, or other profession. Since I feel that it will still have a significant influence on Earth, I am willing to do anything I can as a student to help limit the emission of greenhouse gases, even if it is just a small amount. Similar to this advocacy, this enables students like myself to make a difference even with small deeds. And I'm hoping that by doing this, the viewers will be affected.</p>
