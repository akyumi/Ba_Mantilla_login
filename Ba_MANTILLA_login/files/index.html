        		<h1>WHAT</h1>
        		<p>The Earth is covered in greenhouse gas emissions, which trap solar heat. Due to this, the environment is changing and warming up. At this time in recorded history, the planet is warming more quickly than ever.</p>
        		<p>In order to stop climate change on Earth, everyone —children, teenagers, and adults—can make a difference. Even as a student or even as an adult, you can contribute to the project's goal of preventing climate change.</p>
        		<p>We want to support the United Nations' advocacy, which is the "Act Now" campaign. We can change the world by how we travel, how much electricity we use, and what we eat. </p>

        		<h1>MEASURE YOUR CARBON FOOTPRINTS</h1>
        		<p>Many of our daily activities, such as using a vehicle and disposing of waste, produce greenhouse gas emissions. Understanding how our activities and habits affect the environment is an essential first step in leading a more healthier approach and addressing the climate crisis.</p>
